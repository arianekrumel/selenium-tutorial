<p>User interface testing is just on the the software testing focuses for different layers of the product. UI testing interacts with the product as the user would use it in order to verify product functionality. Manual ui testing can consume many quality assurance resources because of the amount of time and attention to detail it requires. UI testing via a tool such as Selenium can produce more efficient and accurate tests as well as provide more detailed bug reports when an error is found.</p>

<p>Selenium can be used to create UI-driven integration and regression tests to test the system as it will be used. Integration testing is the software testing phase where the product modules are combined and tested as a group. As code that has already been created and tested is changed or updates, regression testing verifies that the product continues to work as expected. One of the biggest benefits of automated UI testing is finding regression errors. Automation is ideal for situations where a small change is made but the entire functionality of the system as a whole can be tested again so that testers do less repetitive work. </p>

<p>Lastly, automation of ui testing can even help with manual testing itself by automating a certain part of a sequence. This will allow the automated setup of a testing environment to a particular state so that a tester can test something down the line of a sequence of ui events.

<p>Selenium started as a Thoughtwork project in 2004 for an automated testing framework. Selenium has a testing suite of projects that implement browser automation tools, APIs or frameworks. Here is some brief information about the WebDriver, Grid, IDE and Remote Control:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Selenium Remote Control</strong><br />
This first version had a client which sent commands and a server that drove the browser with a JavaScript engine. RC server accepts commands for the browser via HTTP.</li>
  <li><strong>Selenium WebDriver</strong><br />
This is a newer project compared to the RC used a methodology from a competitor named Web Driver that operated closer to the native browser API. It is implemented through a browser driver that receives commands and results. It uses a browser instance instead of a special server like the RC. It uses native operating system level functionality instead of browser-based JavaScript when possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Selenium IDE</strong><br />
This option is a Integrated Development Environment installed as a plug-in exclusively for the Mozilla Firefox browser. It has the functionality to recording and play interaction, select elements by text, ids, attributes and other commands to create automated tests. Also, it has the great benefit of replaying the test live in the browser so that testers can observe the testing sequence and visual layouts.</li>
  <li><strong>Selenium Grid</strong><br />
Selenium Grid is a project that uses one server acting as a hub to run tests on several remote machines. The test interact with the hub to obtain browser instances. The hub can spread the testing load across different machines, run tests in parallel and utilize servers with different platforms or operating systems.</li>
</ul>
