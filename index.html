<p>User interface testing is just on the the software testing focuses for different layers of the product. UI testing interacts with the product as the user would use it in order to verify product functionality. Manual ui testing can consume many quality assurance resources because of the amount of time and attention to detail it requires. UI testing via a tool such as Selenium can produce more efficient and accurate tests as well as provide more detailed bug reports when an error is found.</p>

<p>Selenium can be used to create UI-driven integration and regression tests to test the system as it will be used. Integration testing is the software testing phase where the product modules are combined and tested as a group. As code that has already been created and tested is changed or updates, regression testing verifies that the product continues to work as expected. One of the biggest benefits of automated UI testing is finding regression errors. Automation is ideal for situations where a small change is made but the entire functionality of the system as a whole can be tested again so that testers do less repetitive work. </p>

<p>Lastly, automation of ui testing can even help with manual testing itself by automating a certain part of a sequence. This will allow the automated setup of a testing environment to a particular state so that a tester can test something down the line of a sequence of ui events.
